# All-the-News-That-s-Fit-to-Scrape-wk18

This an application that allows you to scrape articles from BBC.com/sport. Users can then view and leave comments on articles. 

In this application I used: Express, HTML, JavaScript, JQuery, Node.js, Mongoose, Axios, and Cheerio. 

The app is designed to scrape the articles from the above site and allows the user to add notes. This uses Mongoose to store notes and articles. 

You will need to open your browser on localhost:3000.
